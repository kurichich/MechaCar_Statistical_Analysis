# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
  A car company called AutosRUs is having production troubles with a new prototype called MechaCar.  We are required to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.
  
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  The prototype data for 50 car is given.  Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle.  We've designed a linear model that predicts mpg of the prototypes.  Based on the p-values in the results, vehicle weight and AWD have a significant impact on mpg.
